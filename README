MapOSMatic is a web application to generate maps of cities or towns,
including index of streets, from OpenStreetMap data.

It is made of two components:

 * maposmatic, the web front-end. An application written using the
   Django framework allows to submit and visualize map rendering jobs.
   The rendering is done in the background by a daemon;

 * ocitysmap, the back-end that generates the map. It is available as a
   Python module, used both by the maposmatic daemon (above) and by a
   sample command line application.

This source tree contains maposmatic, the web front-end.
